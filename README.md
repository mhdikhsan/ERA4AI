# ERA4AI: Engineering Requirements and Assessment for Responsible AI

ERA4AI is an ontology-based framework designed to support responsible and transparent AI system development. It integrates requirements engineering, ethical compliance, risk assessment, and traceability.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Formalize system, ethical, and risk-based requirements for AI systems
- Enable traceable and auditable design via ontological representations
- Support ethical impact assessment through requirements modeling
- Align with frameworks like IEEE 7000, SWeMLS, and AIRO

## 🧩 Core Features

- 📚 Ontology for AI requirements (ERA4AI)
- 🧠 Integration of value-based and ethical value requirements (EVRs)
- ⚠️ Risk modeling with mitigation strategies
- 🧭 Traceability from stakeholder values to technical artifacts
- 📈 Semantic knowledge graph to support querying and validation
