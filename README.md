# ERA4AI: Engineering Requirements and Assessment for Responsible AI

ERA4AI is an ontology-based framework designed to support responsible and transparent AI system development. It integrates requirements engineering, ethical compliance, risk assessment, and traceability to facilitate better decision-making throughout the AI lifecycle.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Formalize system, ethical, and risk-based requirements for AI systems
- Enable traceable and auditable design via ontological representations
- Support ethical impact assessment through requirements modeling
- Align with frameworks like IEEE 7000, ALTAI, and AIRO

## 🧩 Core Features

- 📚 Ontology for AI requirements (RE4AI)
- 🧠 Integration of value-based and ethical value requirements (EVRs)
- ⚠️ Risk modeling with mitigation strategies
- 🧭 Traceability from stakeholder values to technical artifacts
- 📈 Semantic knowledge graph to support querying and validation

## 📄 Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `RE4AI Ontology` | Core classes for system, ethical, and risk requirements |
| `Case Studies` | Real-world examples applying ERA4AI (e.g., Medical AI, Chatbot) |
| `SPARQL Library` | Queries for competency questions and validation |
| `Ethics Case Generator` | Template for generating "Case for Ethics" documentation |

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Medical diagnostic systems
- Language model-based AI assistants
- Ethical auditing and impact assessment for high-risk AI
